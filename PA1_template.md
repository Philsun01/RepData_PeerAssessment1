Since there is a date value, we will convert that into a date class.

```r
act_date <- as.Date(act$date)
```

There are many NA's in the Steps column, we'll convert those to zero to avoid issues with plotting.

```r
act$steps <- as.integer(act$steps)
```

## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?

First we group the steps by day.


```r
act_day <- summarize(group_by(act,date), 
                     steps = sum(steps, na.rm = TRUE))

## What is the average daily activity pattern?
First we make a time series chart of all 5 min5ute intervals and calculate the average steps taken every 5 min5utes.

```r
min5 <- summarise(group_by(act,interval), steps = mean(steps, na.rm = TRUE))

<<<<<<< HEAD
plot(min5$interval, min5$steps, type = "l", main = "Average Steps for each 5 min interval", xlab = "Interval", ylab = "Steps")

max_pos <- match(max(min5$steps),min5$steps)
print( paste0("The highest steps interval is ", min5$interval[max_pos] ) )
```

```

```

## Inputing missing values
First we check for how many incomplete rows there are: 

```r
act2 <- act
for(i in names(act2)){
    print(paste0("Column ", i, 
                 " has ",
                 sum(is.na(act2[i])) ,
                 " NA's"))
}
```

```
## [1] "Column steps has 2304 NA's"
## [1] "Column date has 0 NA's"
## [1] "Column interval has 0 NA's"
```
There are 2304 incomplete rows all in the steps column.  We will attempt to substitute and fill in those empty cells with the mean across all intervals.


```r
    pos <- 0
    for( i in act2$steps){
        pos <- pos + 1
        if(is.na(i)){
            inter <- act2$interval[pos]
            inter_pos <- which(act2$interval == inter)
            int_mean <- mean(act2$steps[inter_pos], na.rm = TRUE)
            act2$steps[pos] <- round(int_mean)
        }
    }
```

Now we look at the new stats for the filled in dataframe:

```r
act2_day <- summarize(group_by(act2,date), 
                     steps = sum(steps, na.rm = TRUE))

daily_steps_mean2 <- round(mean(act2_day$steps))
print(paste("Average Daily Steps is with filled in values", daily_steps_mean2))
```

```

>>>>>>> e46f03229ac537839b5f50e7b7115f84faa1deba
```

```r
daily_steps_med2 <- round(median(act2_day$steps))
print(paste("Median Daily Steps with filled in values is", daily_steps_med2))
```

```
<<<<<<< HEAD
## [1] "Median Daily Steps with filled in values is 10762"
```

```r
hist(act2_day$steps, main = "Histogram of Daily Steps", xlab = "Step Range", ylab = "Steps")

```

![](PA1_template_files/figure-html/Checking filled in data-1.png)<!-- -->

After filling the values, it is clear from the historgrams that the daily step values have shifted toward the median.

### Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?

## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
>>>>>>> e46f03229ac537839b5f50e7b7115f84faa1deba

We first label what day of the week each date is and break the data down inbetween weekend and weekday


```r
<<<<<<< HEAD
#First we create a column of day names
act2$day <- weekdays(as.Date(act2$date), abbreviate = TRUE)
#Then we create a column of weekday or weekend types.(Weekday by Default)
act2$day_type <- "Weekday"
#Now we run a GREP search of all cells that contain "SUN"" or "SAT"" and replace that column type with "Weekend"
act2[ grep("Sun|Sat",act2$day),"day_type"] <- "Weekend"
act2$day_type <- as.factor(act2$day_type)
=======
wk <- weekdays(as.Date(act2$date), abbreviate = TRUE)
act3 <- cbind(act2,wk)
wkend <- subset(act3, act3$wk == "Sun"|act3$wk == "Sat")
wkday <- subset(act3, act3$wk != "Sun" & act3$wk != "Sat")
>>>>>>> e46f03229ac537839b5f50e7b7115f84faa1deba
```

Now we plot the 2 data sets


```r
<<<<<<< HEAD
xyplot(steps~interval|day_type, type = "l", data = act2, layout = c(1,2))
=======
wkday_sum <- summarise(group_by(wkday,interval), steps = mean(steps, na.rm = TRUE))

plot(wkday_sum$interval, wkday_sum$steps, type = "l", main = "Weekday vs Weekend Step Pattern", xlab = "Interval", ylab = "Steps", ylim = c(0,300), col = "blue")

wkend_sum <- summarise(group_by(wkend,interval), steps = mean(steps, na.rm = TRUE))

lines(wkend_sum$interval, wkend_sum$steps, col = "green")
legend("topright", c("Weekday","Weekend"),col = c("blue","green"), bg = "gray", cex = .75, lty = 1, bty = "n")
>>>>>>> e46f03229ac537839b5f50e7b7115f84faa1deba
```

![](PA1_template_files/figure-html/Plot weekday vs weekend-1.png)<!-- -->

The overlayed graphs show there is more steps taken during weekday mornings, and then some more in the evening while the weekends have a more even spread of walking throughout the day.
